### This is a comprehensive typescript course with notes and examples.

  - typescript is a programming language on the top of javascript.
  - It includes everything that javascript has and also includes additional things. 
  - it's static typed means variables are static or one type.
  - refactoring, code completion and adding new features makes typescript better that java script

  - *Disadvantage* of typescript is that it needs compilation before running. This compilation process means changing the typescript to java script code.
          e.g ```tsc index.ts```
          - use only ```tsc``` to compile the whole code.

  - you can initialize and setup the ts compiler using 
                 ```tsc --init```
